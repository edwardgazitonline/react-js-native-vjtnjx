Lists are used to display data in an ordered format and mainly used to display menus on websites. In React, Lists can be created in a similar way as we create lists in JavaScript. 

var numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];   
const multiplyNums = numbers.map((number)=>{   
    return (number * 5);   
});   
console.log(multiplyNums);
