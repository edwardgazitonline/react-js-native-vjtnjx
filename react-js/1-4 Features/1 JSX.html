JSX JavaScript Extension
  All of the React components have a render function. The render function specifies the HTML output of a React component. 

  JSX provides you to write HTML/XML-like structures (e.g., DOM-like tree structures)

  Example
    Here, we will write JSX syntax in JSX file and see the corresponding JavaScript code which transforms by preprocessor(babel).
    JSX File
    <div>Hello JavaTpoint</div>  

    Corresponding Output
    React.createElement("div", null, "Hello JavaTpoint");  



  Nested Elements in JSX
  App.jsx : Here, we use div as a container element which has three nested elements inside it.

      import React, { Component } from 'react';  
      class App extends Component{  
        render(){  
            return(  
              <div>  
                  <h1>JavaTpoint</h1>  
                <h2>Training Institutes</h2>  
                  <p>This website contains the best CS tutorials.</p>  
              </div>  
            );  
        }  
      }  
      export default App;  


Attributes
  JSX uses camelcase naming convention for attributes rather than standard naming convention of HTML such as a class in HTML becomes className in JSX because the class is the reserved keyword in JavaScript. 
  <p data-demoAttribute = "demo">This website contains the best CS tutorials.</p>  



Comments
  JSX allows us to use comments that begin with /* and ends with */ and wrapping them in curly braces {} just like in the case of JSX expressions. 
   {/* This is a comment in JSX */}   


Styling
  React always recommends to use inline styles. To set inline styles, you need to use camelCase syntax. React automatically allows appending px after the number value on specific elements. 
  import React, { Component } from 'react';  

  class App extends Component{  
    render(){  
      var myStyle = {  
          fontSize: 80,  
          fontFamily: 'Courier',  
          color: '#003300'  
        }  
        return (  
          <div>  
              <h1 style = {myStyle}>www.javatpoint.com</h1>  
          </div>  
        );  
    }  
  }  
  export default App; 



  NOTE: JSX cannot allow to use if-else statements. Instead of it, you can use conditional (ternary) expressions. It can be seen in the following example.
      import React, { Component } from 'react';  
    class App extends Component{  
      render(){  
          var i = 5;  
          return (  
            <div>  
                <h1>{i == 1 ? 'True!' : 'False!'}</h1>  
            </div>  
          );  
      }  
    }  
    export default App;
