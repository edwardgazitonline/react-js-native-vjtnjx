2 Ways
  There are two ways to generate a production-ready build for Android, so we are presenting both of them below.

  #1 Using React Native CLI
    Step 1. Generate a keystore
      You will need a Java generated signing key which is a keystore file used to generate a React Native executable binary for Android. 

      keytool -genkey -v -keystore your_key_name.keystore -alias your_key_alias -keyalg RSA -keysize 2048 -validity 10000
      
      Once you run the keytool utility, youâ€™ll be prompted to type in a password. Make sure you remember the password:
    
    Step 2. Adding Keystore to your project
      Firstly, you need to copy the file your_key_name.keystore and paste it under the android/app directory in your React Native project folder.
      mv my-release-key.keystore /android/app

    Step 3. Release APK Generation
      cd android
      Windows: gradlew assembleRelease
      Mac: ./gradlew assembleRelease

      As a result, the APK creation process is done. You can find the generated APK at android/app/build/outputs/apk/app-release.apk. This is the actual app, which you can send to your phone or upload to the Google Play Store.

#2 Generate a React Native Release Build with Android Studio

  Step 1: Set Up Your Android Production Environment
  Step 2: Install the JDK
  Step 3: Generate a Release APK using Android Studio
