/*
React Native Alert is an API which is used to display an alert dialog with specified title and message. It uses an alert() method to prompt an alert dialog. This Alert dialog provides three different lists of buttons (combination of neutral, negative, and positive) to perform action. Pressing any of these buttons calls the onPress callback method and dismiss the alert. By default, Alert has only a positive (OK) button.
