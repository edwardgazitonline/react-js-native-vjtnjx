Native Google Map
Google map is used to locate an address, navigate, and search location in the mobile devices. The Google Maps shows the location (latitude and longitude) using dot Marker. In the react-native, Google Maps is easily integrated using react-native-maps npm library. To use Google Maps in our application, we need to authenticate the Google Maps API.
